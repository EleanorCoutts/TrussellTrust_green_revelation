# TrussellTrust_green_revelation
Data analysis in support of Operational Research society pro-bono work for Trussell Trust: project Green Relevation

Effort so far: combine multiple data sources to a single table, and plot a scatter graph.

Data used not included in repo - download from dropbox and and put in folder ./data

RProject used so all file paths relative to the root directory where the .RProject file is.
